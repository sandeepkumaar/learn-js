## Imperative programming
Imperative programming *performs* an action/mutation/side-effect.It tells 
the *control flow*. 


## Declarative programming
*Expresses* the **logic** of a computation without describing its control flow.

## Side Effect
A function or expression is said to have side-effects if it modifies some state variables
*outside* it local environment. 
The outside environment could be browser, i/o service etc

## State variable
Variable capable changing the state of the environment. 

Side effects are necessary, because thats how app responds. But how to handle them 
effectively is what different programming differs


## Note:
Object-oriented programming makes code understandable by encapsulating moving parts.
Functional programming makes code understandable by minizing the moving parts.


Here `moving parts` is the side-effects and each paradigm handles them differently
- Encapsulation  (OOP)
- Separate logic from action (Functional)


## Key
Imperative - Encapsulation - Declarative.

> Encapsulate Imperative code and hack away the logic in to declarative code to 
minimize the imperativeness
