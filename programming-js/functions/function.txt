Functions:
	Functions are building blocks of an application
	In Javascript, Functions are	
		- first class
		- functions as Objects
		- runtime function definition
		
What is first class citizen in programming language?
	First class citizen is an entity which supports all the operations generally
	available to other entities
	Operation typically include
		- entity being passed as an argument
		- returned from a function
		- modified
		- assigned to a variable
		
Guidelines for Better functions:
	- DRY  	Don't Repeat Yourself
	- DOT		Do One Thing
	- KISS 	Keep It Simple Stupid
	
	
Immutability:
Note:
In javascript complex datatypes are arrays and objects 
They are pass by reference meaning they pass as address*

Arrays and Objects behave in the same way with some differences
	- Keys(string) in Object are Index(number) in arrays
	- we can assign/create Index like Key in arrays
	
var x = [];
x[20] = "sandeep"	;
x; // [empty,empty,.. ,20]
x[0] // undefined

Datastructures represented by these non-primitive types are called Collections
Objects --> Arrays 	// Object.keys(); Object.values()
Arrays --> Objects  // reduce
can be converted easily


Why immutability?
Inorder to minimize side effects we should clone the object,array,dataStruture

Directly this is not possible for deep dataStrutures
But we can enforce this when performing operations inside functions by 
cloning every possible bits into a cloned 
This way we can achieve immutability at max

some of the methods that return a new collection,array,object

Object:
	Object.create(); //simple objects

Arrays:
	slice();
	spread?
	map
	filter
	reduce
	other array methods
