/**
Generic Programming :
	Attempts to express algorithms(functions/lambdas) and datastructures (array,object)
	that is type agnostic 
	ie. the function will not worry about the type of the arguments passed
	Its able to perform the algorithm on the passed type
	
	Note:
	Generic programming typically starts with one or more type specific implementations,
	which then get lifted(abstracted) to create a more generic version that will work 
	with new set of types
	
	Note:
	Unlike function polymorphism, which based on the arguments(type,number) conditionally
	branch to implement the algorithm differently,
	generics rely on the datatypes passed to support the algorithm implementation
	
	The required features that is required by the arguments for the algorithm to work
	is called 'requirements'
	which in turn gets collected into sets called 'concepts'
	concept = [requirement_1,requirement_2];
	
	Unlike function polymorphism(ad-hoc polymorphism), 
	Generics employ Parametric polymorphism
