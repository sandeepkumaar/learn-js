## Algorithms 

How to approach ? 

- Leverage Native Laguage features as much as possible. Try to relate all DS algorithms with Language features. 
Some of them, even better structures are already implement in native language. 


Eg: in Javascript
- Objects ==>  HashMap
- Array ==> Queue, Stack 
- Set 
- Map 
- WeakSet
- WeakMap
- Iterators
- Symbol


When you look at a code, identify if its algorithm related or DS related. 
Algorithms are mathematical. simple *pure* functions that takes an input and responds with output. 


Note: There are always 2 version of code 
1. Readable, Predictable implementations and Not very optimised
2. Less readable, optimised 

Its better to go from 1 to 2. 


Note 2: Complete Knowledge on all methods from 
- Array 
- string
- Math

And how to implement them without those methods?
