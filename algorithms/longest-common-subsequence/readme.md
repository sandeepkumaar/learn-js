## Iterative
- create a dp array with initial 0
- iterate. 
- if match found add 1 to previous solution/addition
- if no match -  max of previous

- backtrack from last
- if match - add to string and move both pointers. so it goes to previous solution/addition
- if no match - move to the pointer having max prev value
