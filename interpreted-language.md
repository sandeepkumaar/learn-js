## Javascript is an Interpreted language

Basically c,c++, java compiled before executed.Compier takes the code
and produces a machine efficient representation of it, usally optimized for 
runtime performance

Scripting languages such as javascript,vbscript are interpreted which means the
browser runs each line of JS code as it gets to it.
They place less importance on runtime performance and are more geared towards 
tasks like prototyping,interactive coding and flexibility
But now browsers has found a middle ground 
	-JS is compiled on the fly.giving both the advantage of compilation and 
	interpretation
