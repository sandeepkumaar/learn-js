## Summary


## List

> It's a common mis-statement that "everything in JavaScript is an object". This is clearly not true.

Object *sub-types* which can be called as complex primitives

## Built-in Types

- null      // primitive
- undefined // primitive
- boolean   // primitive
- number    // primitive
- string    // primitive
- object    // non-primitive
- symbol    // primitive

Types that are available to JS language. Since JS has only *Basic types* they are
also called as *Weakly typed language / Dynamic type language*.
This is in contrast to their counterpart languages such as Java where

## Built-in functions

- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Object
- Function
- Array
- Date
- RegExp
- Error

These are **function Constructor** that are used to create objects of *type* `object`


object// accessing property
- dot notation
- [] // computed property

object properties as opposed to methods

## Arrays:
numeric indexing
arrays are objects // can add properties

## Duplication objects
circular reference
JSON-safe
shallow copy

## Property Descriptors
- writable
- Enumerable
- configurable

immutability // shallow copy
- object constant
- prevent extensions
- seal
- freeze


Getters and setters

Existence
- enumeration

Iteration



## Class design pattern
- constructor
- inheritance // copy
- polymorphism //

what it offers in general sense. wiki
advantages
code reuse


## Prototypes
- override properties
- Prototypal inheritance
- Inspecting class relationships/ object relationships
- Object links

## Behaviour delegation
